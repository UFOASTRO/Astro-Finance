## transaction is not stored based on the current id 


SOLUTION 
----------
TRANSACTION IS STORED IN THE CURRENT ID so when you want it to display it should only display the transactions in the transaction {} object , transaction id ?

when we want to show tranasction history it should show only the transactions of the current logged in user ,
all the tranastions are stored with a transaction id inside a transactions object for each user 

1:User{
    transactions{
        1:transactionId{"transfer","-$20"}
        2:transactionId{"transfer","-$20"}
    }
}

so when we want to access a user tranasaction history to display , we need to first access the current logged in userId using (UserId)
i think it should be in the show account function (show all information about an account)
//output 1
then access the current user transactions object **transactions{}**
from there we will display the all the users transaction by id 
**transactionId** one by one 
so there should be a template for displaying each value of the tranasction id 


the tranasction history of who is logged in to show. 
so when a transaction is made it should be stored to the userid||||||


loop through each id and check if the user exsist , if it does
